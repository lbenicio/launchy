2. Email `security@lbenicio.dev` with a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any proof-of-concept details.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
4. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure with you to ensure users can update promptly.

## Security Best Practices

- Always download builds from trusted sources.
- Keep macOS and Launchy updated to the latest versions.
- Avoid running or modifying the codebase with elevated privileges unless necessary.
